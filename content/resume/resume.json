  "summary": "Senior Site Reliability Engineer with 6+ years of experience operating and stabilizing distributed, cloud, and on-prem systems. I am currently focused on AI and MLOps infrastructure, applying proven SRE principles to ensure reliability, observability, performance, and operational safety of AI-enabled and data-intensive systems in production. With a strong background in observability, incident response, and deep system analysis, I approach AI workloads from a production-first perspective—prioritizing predictability, debuggability, and scalability over experimentation. Throughout my career, I have consistently used analytical and AI-assisted tools to understand complex system behavior; today, I apply that experience to building and operating the infrastructure that supports AI at scale.",
