TypeScript has become the standard for building large-scale JavaScript applications. In this post, we'll explore best practices for writing type-safe code.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript offers several advantages:

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
- **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocomplete and refactoring
- **Improved Documentation**: Types serve as inline documentation
- **Scalability**: Easier to maintain large codebases

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Strict Mode

Always enable strict mode in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

### 2. Avoid `any`

The `any` type defeats the purpose of TypeScript. Use `unknown` or proper types instead.

### 3. Leverage Type Inference

TypeScript can infer types in many cases. Don't over-annotate:

```typescript
// Good
const name = "John"

// Unnecessary
const name: string = "John"
```

## Conclusion

TypeScript is a powerful tool that can significantly improve your development experience and code quality. By following best practices, you can build more robust applications.
