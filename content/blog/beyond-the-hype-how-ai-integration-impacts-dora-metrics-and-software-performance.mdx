# Introduction

Organizations are rapidly adopting Generative AI to accelerate software development, but increased "typing speed" does not always translate to business value. According to recent research from the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) team, many teams found that more AI usage initially led to decreased stability and throughput. This article explores the latest DORA findings on AI integration, the shift from four to five key metrics, and the specific organizational capabilities required to turn AI into a performance amplifier rather than a bottleneck.

## Key Takeaways

- The Fifth Metric: DORA has officially added Deployment Rework Rate to its core performance metrics to better measure stability [10:57].

- The Amplifier Effect: AI amplifies existing system strengths or frictions; it often highlights downstream bottlenecks like slow code reviews [18:52].

- Documentation Gains: Contrary to common assumptions, AI is improving documentation quality by reducing the "blank page" barrier for engineers [25:10].

- The J-Curve: Most teams experience an initial dip in performance during AI adoption before seeing long-term gains [39:04].

- Trust Paradox: While 2025 data shows higher reported productivity, 30% of practitioners still have little to no trust in AI-generated output [29:55].

## The Evolution of DORA: From Four Metrics to Five

For over a decade, the DORA research program has defined software delivery performance through four key metrics: lead time for changes, deployment frequency, failed deployment recovery time, and change failure rate. However, the 2024 and 2025 reports introduce a critical fifth metric: Deployment Rework Rate [10:57].

This new metric tracks the frequency of unplanned deployments required to correct previous changes. Together, these five metrics measure two high-level factors: throughput and stability. High-performing teams demonstrate that these factors are not a trade-off; rather, they move in tandem. Teams with fast throughput typically maintain the highest stability [11:29].

## The AI Amplifier: Solving the Wrong Problem

A common pitfall in AI adoption is the focus on code generation. While AI can help developers write code faster, "typing" is rarely the true bottleneck in the software delivery lifecycle [16:18]. If an organization has a slow manual code review process, AI-generated code will simply flood that bottleneck, increasing friction and slowing down the overall system [20:07].

AI acts as an amplifier. In a healthy system with fast feedback loops, AI speeds up the flow of value. In a disconnected system with high friction, AI highlights and exacerbates existing pains [18:57].

## The DORA AI Capabilities Model

To successfully scale AI, DORA identifies seven specific capabilities that amplify the impact of AI adoption [21:40]:

1. **Clear Policy**: A communicated stance on how and when to use AI [21:58].

2. **Data Ecosystem**: High-quality, well-connected data to avoid "garbage in, garbage out" [22:04].

3. **Internal Data Access**: AI must have access to context-specific internal documentation [22:15].

4. **Strong Version Control**: Frequent check-ins allow for reliable rollbacks when AI makes errors [22:23].

5. **Small Batches**: Breaking large changes into smaller components improves AI accuracy and review speed [22:41].

6. **User-Centric Focus**: Using AI to solve user needs rather than for the sake of the technology itself [22:52].

7. **Internal Platforms**: A robust internal developer platform (IDP) provides the necessary infrastructure for AI tools [23:05].

## The Documentation Surprise

One of the most positive findings in the recent DORA research is that AI usage correlates with improved documentation quality [25:30]. Engineers are utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as a "crutch" to overcome the resistance to writing from scratch. It is significantly easier for a technical expert to edit a draft generated by an LLM than to face a blank page [26:40]. Additionally, AI's ability to summarize complex, spread-out documentation helps teams extract more utility from their existing knowledge bases [27:00].

## Navigating the AI Trust Paradox

There is a notable "Trust Paradox" within technical teams. While many individuals report feeling more productive, a significant portion remain skeptical of AI accuracy. In 2025, roughly 30% of respondents reported little to no trust in AI outputs [30:03].

Trust in this context is often defined as meeting expectations. If a user expects mediocre results and receives them, their "trust" in the tool's behavior increases, even if the output remains flawed [31:50]. To counter this, organizations must implement strong feedback mechanisms to validate AI-generated content for truthfulness and validity [30:50].

## How to Implement: Next Steps for Technical Leads

To effectively integrate AI into your delivery pipeline, avoid a tool-first approach. Instead, follow these steps:

1. **Perform Value Stream Mapping**: Assemble a cross-functional team to map the flow of an idea from conception to production. This exercise identifies where friction actually lives [43:22].

2. **Identify Downstream Constraints**: Ensure your code review and testing processes can handle increased code volume before deploying AI coding assistants.

3. **Contextualize Research**: Treat DORA's findings as a hypothesis. Test whether improving a specific capability (like continuous integration) actually moves your team's metrics [13:40].

4. **Focus on Utility**: Start by using AI for summarizing documentation or drafting "getting started" guides to provide immediate value with lower risk [26:15].

## Conclusion

AI is not a "magic button" for software performance; it is a powerful tool that reflects the quality of the system it inhabits. By focusing on the seven DORA AI capabilities and monitoring the five core metrics, technical leaders can navigate the "J-curve" of transformation and ensure AI drives meaningful business outcomes. The "physics" of software delivery remains the same: the goal is to deliver small, high-quality changes to users as safely and frequently as possible.
